        It brings about new opportunities and challenges in several economic fields. 
        IoT is an exciting technology that opens many possibilities for greenhouse cultivation. 
        Moreover, it can be applied to various technical solutions that identify objects, as well as 
        capturing, storing, processing, and transferring data in physical environments and in between 
        physical and virtual worlds. IoT supports the transition from the traditional greenhouse to 
        smart solutions, which consists of an intelligent greenhouse equipped to track the indoor
